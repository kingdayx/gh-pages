                    <p class="para">
                      I have been writing code for 7 years! My first language was C++
                      back when I was 17!
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">When I was in grade school I wanted to be a Quantum computer programmer(writing code for quantum computers for Google or IBM). However, I thought that it may be too hard for me and decided to take on a career in Computer Engineering. As I was running my own computer repair store with a partner I learned that my career is becoming obsolete. Writing my first C++ application 2 years prior, I decided to take computer programming back up again and become a Full Stack Web Developer. Two years later, someone challenged me to learn blockchain development in 3 months embarking me on this niche coding journey.</p>
                    <p class="para">
                      
                      I started learning React and React Native about 3 years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">I intend to solve real world problems with blockchain development.As of now, I have learned Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain and am now beginning to learn Substrate using Rust.</p>
                    <p class="para">
                      I intend to get certified as a software engineer at Thinkful!
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">I enjoy playing League of Legends for my free time. I also enjoy watching Netflix and spending time with my friends and family.</p>
                    <p class="para">
                      If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a
                      partner for a hackathon) please reach out! I am so excited to work
                      with other developers to build great software.
