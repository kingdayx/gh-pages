          <p class="para">
            I have been writing code for 7 years! My first language was C++ back
            when I was 17!
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            When I was in grade school I wanted to be a Quantum computer
            programmer(writing code for quantum computers for Google or IBM).
            However, I thought that it may be too hard for me and decided to
            take on a career in Computer Engineering. As I was running my own
            computer repair store with a partner I learned that my career is
            becoming obsolete. Writing my first C++ application 2 years prior, I
            decided to take computer programming back up again and become a Full
            Stack Web Developer. Two years later, someone challenged me to learn
            blockchain development in 3 months embarking me on this niche coding
            journey.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            I started learning React and React Native about 3 years ago.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            I intend to solve real world problems with blockchain development.As
            of now, I have learned Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain and am
            now beginning to learn Substrate using Rust.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            I intend to get certified as a software engineer at Thinkful!
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            I enjoy playing League of Legends for my free time. I also enjoy
            watching Netflix and spending time with my friends and family.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a
            partner for a hackathon) please reach out! I am so excited to work
            with other developers to build great software.
