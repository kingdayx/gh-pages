          I have been writing code for 7 years! My first language was C++ back
          when I was 17!
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          When I was in grade school I wanted to be a Quantum computer
          programmer(writing code for quantum computers for Google or IBM).
          However, I thought that it may be too hard for me and decided to take
          on a career in Computer Engineering. As I was running my own computer
          repair store with a partner I learned that my career is becoming
          obsolete. Writing my first C++ application 2 years prior, I decided to
          take computer programming back up again and become a Full Stack Web
          Developer. Two years later, someone challenged me to learn blockchain
          development in 3 months embarking me on this niche coding journey.

          I started learning React and React Native about 3 years ago.

        <p class="para">
          I intend to solve real world problems with blockchain development.As
          of now, I have learned Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain and am now
          beginning to learn Substrate using Rust.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          I intend to get certified as a software engineer at Thinkful!
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          I enjoy playing League of Legends for my free time. I also enjoy
          watching Netflix and spending time with my friends and family.

        <p class="para">
          If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a
          partner for a hackathon) please reach out! I am so excited to work
          with other developers to build great software.
